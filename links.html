<!--to make a link in HTML, you need to start with an "alligator mouth" (<) and then add a href to tell the browser that it is going to be a link. After this, we need a website or 
a domain that the link will take us to. To do this we need to do an equal sign and put the link of the domain in quotes (you pick the domain. I am going to do Google) 
After this end the "alligator mouth" (>) here. This will create the link-->

<!--After that we need to have some text showing so that when you click on this text it will take you to the link. To do this, you need to just put any word or phrase. Then nest
this link with </a>-->

<!--It should look like something shown below-->

<a href="https://www.google.com">Click here to go to Google</a>
